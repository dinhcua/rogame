# Rust Code Refactoring Summary

## Overview
The Rust codebase has been refactored to improve code quality, maintainability, and scalability.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Error Handling
- Created a custom `AppError` enum with proper error variants
- Implemented proper error conversion traits
- Removed string-based error handling in favor of typed errors
- Added error context and chaining

### 2. Module Organization
```
src/
├── commands/         # Tauri command handlers
│   ├── game_commands.rs
│   └── save_commands.rs
├── db/              # Database layer
│   ├── connection.rs # Connection management
│   ├── models.rs    # Data models
│   └── repository.rs # Repository pattern
├── game_scanner/    # Game scanning functionality
│   ├── config.rs    # Configuration handling
│   ├── library_scanner.rs # Platform-specific scanning
│   └── models.rs    # Game-related models
├── save_manager/    # Save file management
│   ├── backup.rs    # Backup/restore logic
│   └── models.rs    # Save-related models
├── utils/           # Shared utilities
│   ├── formatting.rs # Size formatting
│   └── paths.rs     # Path handling
└── error.rs         # Error definitions

```

### 3. Database Layer
- Implemented Repository pattern for database operations
- Added connection pooling with lazy initialization
- Separated models from database logic
- Added proper transaction handling
- Improved query performance with indexes

### 4. Code Reusability
- Extracted common path operations to `utils::paths`
- Centralized platform-specific path handling
- Removed duplicate `expand_tilde` and `format_size` functions
- Created reusable components for library scanning

### 5. Type Safety
- Replaced string errors with typed error enum
- Added proper lifetime annotations
- Improved trait bounds and generics
- Fixed mutable reference handling

### 6. Best Practices
- Separated concerns between modules
- Used dependency injection for database access
- Implemented proper error propagation with `?`
- Added structured logging points
- Improved resource cleanup

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Maintainability**: Clear module boundaries make it easier to modify individual components
2. **Testability**: Repository pattern allows easy mocking for unit tests
3. **Scalability**: New game platforms can be added by extending the scanner
4. **Performance**: Connection pooling reduces database overhead
5. **Error Handling**: Typed errors make debugging easier

## Future Improvements

1. Add unit tests for each module
2. Implement async database operations
3. Add configuration file support
4. Implement caching layer
5. Add metrics and monitoring
